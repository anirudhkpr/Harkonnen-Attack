I have completed 7.5% of my scoped work in 12% of the estimated time (5/40 hours spent but 3/40 
My work took longer than expected. It took me 1.66x expected time (5/ 3 hours).

At this point all scope estimations are too preliminary to be accurate. It is likely underestimated.
I will update these measurements in future weeks according after a better picture is obtained.
