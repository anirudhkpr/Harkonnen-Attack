Initial Planning:
Created a plan to program the game tasks. Discussed with TAs to get more insight into best practices and pragmatic
approaches to challenges. Created the first version of documentation.

Task Diagram:

Created a task diagram. After Review the orignal diagram was redone to reflect TA input. Time spent exceeded initial
estimates because of multiple revisions to my designs. This additional time spent at this stage will help
future efforts so I'm glad I did these revisions.
