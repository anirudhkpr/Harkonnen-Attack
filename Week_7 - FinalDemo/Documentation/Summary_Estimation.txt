I have completed 100% of my currently-scoped, estimated work (25 of 17.5hr) in 142% of the initially-estimated time. (54 of 36hr). 
 My best guess of my say/do ratio is 70%, 
so to unbias my estimates after this class, I may want to multiply my estimates by 1.42 (100%/70%)

I had to make changes to my original plans. Instead of focusing on making one complete module,
I should have focused on multiple files so I wouldn't have to make this many changes.
