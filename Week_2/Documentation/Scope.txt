After discussion, I realized that a lot of changes need to be made. I rescoped, drew the diagram again and
clarified a lot of doubts regarding the project.

Reading						1 Hour

After the realization that I had made a few mistakes in the first week of the project. I reread the documentation
given in the first week to get a better grasp.	

Redoing documentation				2 Hours

It seems I initially made a few mistakes in my documentation. It wasn't clear to me in the first week how to create
proper estimations because I did not understand the project completely. I will have to spend time making
corrections to last weeks documentations.
