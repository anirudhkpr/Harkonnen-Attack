Reading

After the realization that I had made a few mistakes in the first week of the project. I reread the documentation
given in the first week to get a better grasp.	

Redoing documentation

It seems I initially made a few mistakes in my documentation. It wasn't clear to me in the first week how to create
proper estimations because I did not understand the project completely. I will have to spend time making
corrections to last weeks documentations.

Slider Input Task

Using the Lab 7 project as a base allows for existing slider input task to be used.

Task Diagram

Remade the task diagram to simplify design and make design changes to get closer to expected requirements.

Planning After Feedback

After discussion, I realized that a lot of changes need to be made. I rescoped, drew the diagram again and
clarified a lot of doubts regarding the project.

ButtonManagement Task

Removed ButtonManagement Task
