I have completed 42% of my scoped work(7.5 / 17.5) in 66% of the estimated time (5/7.5 hours spent) for said work.
My work took shorter than expected. It took me 0.66x expected time (5/ 7.5 hours).

Note that the time estimation has changed so I have to give out fresh numbers. Moreover I did not forsee design 
changes. I think there might be one more
revision. In any case, I will contact the instruction team to ensure that I can also get help in estimation as
I am still a bit confused how  these are calculated.
