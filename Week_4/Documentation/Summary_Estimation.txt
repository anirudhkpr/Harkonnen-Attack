I have completed 57% of my scoped work(10 / 17.5) in 66% of the estimated time (2.5/2.5 hours spent) for said work.
My work took about as long as expected.

Note that even though I made suffecient progress, ideally, I should be slightly ahead of schedule
to get additional time if needed later on. This week was a bit more difficult to work in because of new medication
side effects.
